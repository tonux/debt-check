# Medic Mobile take-home test

The goal is to build a very small self-contained "real world" application to show off our skills at production quality code! We used nodeJs to do the stuff.

## Requirements

* Node 8
* Git

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

## Common setup

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

git clone [https://github.com/tonux/debt-check.git](https://github.com/tonux/debt-check.git)
cd debt-check

```shell script
npm install
```

```shell script
npm install -g .
```

## Run the executable

#### mac
```shell script
./debt-check-macos
```

#### linux
```shell script
./debt-check-linux
```

#### mac
Type "debt-check-win.exe" and press "Enter."
```shell script
debt-check-win.exe
```
